    "# Assignment 1 Part 1 Instructions **[50 marks]**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "You are required to develop a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** from scratch. This includes implementing embeddings, storing them in a vector database, building a retriever, and chaining it with an LLM. You will then **experiment with retrieval parameters** and analyze their effects on system accuracy. A bonus section will allow you to refine the system with **prompt engineering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Build the RAG Chain (20 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Implement embeddings and store them in a **vector database**.  \n",
    "- Implement a retriever and build the **RAG chain** that connects it with an LLM.  \n",
    "- Ensure the pipeline can retrieve relevant chunks and generate answers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Chaining for Extended Context (10 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Implement **chaining** that allows the LLM to go beyond retrieved context.  \n",
    "- Demonstrate how chaining enables multi-step reasoning or broader context handling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Parameter Testing & Report (20 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "- Use the provided dataset of **20 questions** (10 with one-word answers, 10 with no answer).  \n",
    "- Explore different values for:  \n",
    "  - **Chunk size**  \n",
    "  - **Chunk overlap**  \n",
    "  - **Top-K retrieval**  \n",
    "  - **Similarity cutoff threshold**  \n",
    "- Record and analyze how parameter choices affect accuracy.  \n",
    "- Submit a **report** summarizing:  \n",
    "  - The results of your experiments.  \n",
    "  - Explanations of why certain parameters improved or degraded performance.  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bonus: Prompt Engineering (5+5 marks)\n",

    "- Refine your system using **prompt engineering** so that:  \n",
    "  - For answerable questions ‚Üí the LLM provides the correct answer.  \n",
    "  - For unanswerable questions ‚Üí the LLM responds with *‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- Bonus marks can be used to recover deductions from earlier parts.  \n",
    "- Creativity and clarity in prompt design will be rewarded.  \n",
    "- Do **not** use GPT or other AI tools to generate code. Instead, consult the documentation ‚Äî learning to use these tools independently is essential for your course projects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "- **Correctness**: The RAG chain should work end-to-end.  \n",
    "- **Implementation**: Proper embeddings, vector DB, retriever, and chaining.  \n",
    "- **Analysis**: Depth of reasoning in your parameter exploration report.  \n",
    "- **Bonus (Optional)**: Effective prompt engineering to balance correctness and abstention.  \n",
