      "**Key Findings**\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence confirms that Pakistan gained independence on August 14, 1947. This date is widely recognized and supported by historical events, including the swearing-in of Muhammad Ali Jinnah as the first governor general of Pakistan. Additionally, the release of commemorative postage stamps on this occasion further substantiates the fact of Pakistan's independence.\n",

      "While there may be ongoing discussions and debates about the nature and circumstances surrounding Pakistan's independence, our analysis focuses on the core fact of the country's independence in 1947. The historical records and events of that time provide a clear indication of Pakistan's transition to an independent nation.\n",

This report aims to provide a neutral and factual account of this significant historical event, and we hope it will serve as a reliable source of information for the general audience.

    "\n",
    "The Simple Search Agent performed the best with 90% accuracy, followed by Zero-shot LLM at 80%, while the Multi-Agent Crew underperformed at 40%. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Simple Search Agent's success stems from its balanced and streamlined approach: it combines the LLM's reasoning with real-time web access for claim verification. Its singular focus (search $\\rightarrow$ analyze $\\rightarrow$ decide) is efficient and avoids the errors introduced by complex multi-agent handoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Do you think these results were expected?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are unexpected, particularly the Multi-Agent Crew's low performance. Theoretically, its adversarial reasoning (supporting vs. contradicting evidence) should improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, factors contributing to the underperformance likely include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increased complexity:** More agents and handoffs introduce more failure points and opportunities for miscommunication.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Verdict translation challenges:** The crew's nuanced verdicts (CONFIRMED/CONTRADICTED/NEEDS_MORE_INFO) don't map cleanly to a binary True/False, especially when uncertain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conflicting evidence:** The adversarial design may find contradictory information even for straightforward claims, leading to false \"NEEDS_MORE_INFO\" verdicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Simple Search Agent's superior performance suggests that for binary fact-checking, a focused single-agent approach with tool access is often more effective than complex multi-agent architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. If the multi-agent crew was not able to output a final answer - what's better from a social welfare perspective: an output you are not confident about or refraining from giving an output if you are not confident?**\n",
    "\n",
    "From a social welfare perspective, refraining from giving an output when confidence is low is generally the more ethical choice. It prevents misinformation and builds long-term trust. A confident incorrect verdict is more harmful than admitting uncertainty."
